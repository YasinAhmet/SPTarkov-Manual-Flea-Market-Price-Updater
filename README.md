# SPTarkov-Manual-Flea-Market-Price-Updater README
This mod basically draws live prices from Tarkov.Dev's API. Besides of that, you can add manual prices as well, and the manual prices you add will override the live prices.

1- Go to [Mod Folder] => [Config] => [MyCustomPricePacks]. In that folder, you will find MyTestPricePack.json. Check that test file to understand the format. You can make your own price packs(Each json file is a pack) and drop them to the folder whenever you want the prices to be activated. In this way, you can easily deactivate specific packs by dragging them out of the MyCustomPricePacks folder. DO NOT RENAME OR REMOVE MyCustomPricePacks folder.

2- To add a new manual price field, basically get into MyTestPricePack.json or any other json that is in MyCustomPricePacks folder. Add a new Json field and add proper fields. If you don't know how to use Json files, please watch a tutorial.


Good to know:

*You can add ! to start of the file names de-prioritize price packs. I'm not sure if it works or not, but theorically it should work.

*This mod is meant to be used with lots of different price packs, a.k.a more than a couple Jsons. If you dump all of your manual prices in a single file, it will be hard to operate for you.

*RGD-5 Hand Grenade is 25k rubbles for testing purposes. Don't forget to remove it from MyTestPricePack.json


EDIT: I did not know how to use jsons back then ;)
